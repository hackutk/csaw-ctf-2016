# Get Up and Running with CSAW CTF 2016


## 1. Form a team

- If you don't already have a team, then form one! Talk to your peers around you and get teams of size 4-8, though less than 4 is fine. But you probably want more than just you!

## 2. Register your team

- Register your team at [https://ctf.csaw.io/register](https://ctf.csaw.io/register).
    - Choose a password that you are willing to share with all of your teammates.
- Share the password with your team!

## 3. Log into the main challenge board

- Go to [https://ctf.csaw.io/](https://ctf.csaw.io/) and click on the 'Chals' link to get to the challenges.

## 4. Start Hacking!

- Start dividing and conquering the challenges with your team.
- Remember to communicate with your teammates and other teams in order to get the most out of the experience!
- Checkout the resources at [https://hackutk.com/resources.html](https://hackutk.com/resources.html) for suggested tools and VM's to use.
- We recommend downloading [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Kali Linux](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/). Kali Linux is an operating system (like Mac or Windows, but Linux based) that has many of the tools you will find useful in CTF's and in security.
    - Use VirtualBox to open the VirtualBox image you downloaded from the Kali Linux/Offensive Security site and then log into that VM once it boots with the username `root` and password `toor`.
